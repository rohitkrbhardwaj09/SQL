## üî• What is `DROP DATABASE` in SQL?

`DROP DATABASE` ek SQL command hai jo **poori database ko permanently delete** kar deta hai system se ‚Äì including saare tables, views, stored procedures, functions, etc.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Irreversible action** hai ‚Äì ek baar database delete ho gaya toh wapas nahi aayega. Isliye hamesha **backup** lena chahiye.

## üéØ Purpose of `DROP DATABASE`

| Feature      | Detail |
|--------------|--------|
| üéØ Objective | Permanently delete an entire database |
| üß® Outcome   | Saare data, schema, tables, views, indexes ‚Äì sab delete ho jaate hain |

---

## üß† Syntax

```sql
DROP DATABASE database_name;
```

### ‚úÖ Safe Version:

```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS database_name;
```

- `IF EXISTS` use karne se command **fail nahi hoti** agar database exist na kare.

---

## üë®‚Äçüíª Real-World Example

### üîπ Step 1: Create a Sample Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE GeeksForGeeks;
```

### üîπ Step 2: Verify It Exists

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

‚úÖ Output: List me `GeeksForGeeks` dikhai dega.

### üîπ Step 3: Delete the Database

```sql
DROP DATABASE GeeksForGeeks;
```

‚úÖ Output: `DROP DATABASE` confirmation aayega.

### üîπ Step 4: Confirm Deletion

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

‚ùå Output: `GeeksForGeeks` ab list me nahi dikhai dega.

---

## üîê Use `IF EXISTS` for Safe Deletion

```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS GeeksForGeeks;
```

üëâ Ye command pehle check karega ki database exist karta hai ya nahi. Agar hai tabhi delete karega ‚Äì **safe for production scripts**.

## üí° Interview-Worthy Points

| Point | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| üî• **Permanent** | Ek baar drop kiya toh recover nahi hota ‚Äì so backup is must. |

# üìò SQL DROP DATABASE ‚Äì Interview Questions & Answers

---

## ‚ùì 1. What does the `DROP DATABASE` command do in SQL?

**Answer:**  
The `DROP DATABASE` command permanently deletes an entire database from the DBMS. This includes all tables, views, stored procedures, functions, and other database objects. It cannot be undone, so it's recommended to back up the database before executing this command.

---

## ‚ùì 2. Is it possible to recover a database after using `DROP DATABASE`?

**Answer:**  
No. Once a database is dropped using `DROP DATABASE`, it is **permanently removed** and cannot be recovered unless a **backup** was taken beforehand.

---

## ‚ùì 3. What is the syntax of the `DROP DATABASE` command?

**Answer:**
```sql
DROP DATABASE database_name;
```

To safely delete only if it exists:
```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS database_name;
```

---

## ‚ùì 4. What is the purpose of using `IF EXISTS` with `DROP DATABASE`?

**Answer:**  
The `IF EXISTS` clause prevents errors if the database doesn't exist. It's a **safe practice** in scripts and production environments to avoid runtime exceptions.

---

## ‚ùì 5. Who has the privilege to drop a database?

**Answer:**  
Only users with the **necessary privileges** (usually **Database Administrators**) can drop a database. Regular users typically do not have permission to perform this action.

---

## ‚ùì 6. Can we drop a database that is in read-only or offline state?

**Answer:**  
Yes. SQL allows a database to be dropped regardless of its state‚Äîwhether it is **offline**, **read-only**, or **suspect**.

---

## ‚ùì 7. What happens to the associated objects when a database is dropped?

**Answer:**  
All objects including:
- Tables
- Views
- Stored Procedures
- Triggers
- Indexes  
are permanently deleted along with the database.

---

## ‚ùì 8. What precautions should be taken before using `DROP DATABASE`?

**Answer:**
1. Take a complete **backup** of the database.
2. Double-check the **database name**.
3. Ensure you have the correct **permissions**.
4. Use `IF EXISTS` to avoid errors.
5. Make sure the database is not critical or currently in use.

---

## ‚ùì 9. Can system databases be dropped using `DROP DATABASE`?

**Answer:**  
‚ùå No. **System databases** like `master`, `model`, `msdb`, `tempdb` cannot be dropped as they are critical to SQL Server operations.

---

## ‚ùì 10. How do you verify if a database has been successfully dropped?

**Answer:**  
After running `DROP DATABASE`, use:
```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```
If the database no longer appears in the list, it has been successfully deleted.

---

## ‚ùì 11. What happens to database snapshots when a database is dropped?

**Answer:**  
All **database snapshots** associated with the dropped database are also removed. This includes deletion of **NTFS sparse files** used for snapshots.

---

## ‚ùì 12. What steps must be taken before dropping a replicated database?

**Answer:**  
If a database is involved in **replication** (either published or subscribed), replication must be **removed or disabled** before dropping the database.

---

## üß† Summary Tips for Interview

- Always mention **backup** and **IF EXISTS** for safety.
- Use real-world examples like: *"We use this during test DB cleanup in ETL pipelines."*
